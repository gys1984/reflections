When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When working on a project with other people. Or if you want to share your work. It is
also a good way to make a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?
- Change in the remote can cause your work on your own branch to break. It is important to see and be aware 
of the changes, so that you are able to spot the conflicts with the work you are doing and to fix it right away.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. Whe would you use one instead of another?
- When you want to use a project created by some else (and hosted on GitHub) you can fork the project. In this
way, the project will always link back to the creator. Clone you will use when you want to work on a project, and
get it to your local machine. It sets up git tracking. Branches are used when working on specific bug fixes or when
working on new functions. It's a good method when experimenting with your code.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- You now know the difference between the copy on the remote and the local copy, without having to get
online.
