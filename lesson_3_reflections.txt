When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When working on a project with other people. Or if you want to share your work. It is
also a good way to make a backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date
with your remote repository?
- Change in the remote can cause your work on your own branch to break. It is important to see and be aware 
of the changes, so that you are able to spot the conflicts with the work you are doing and to fix it right away.
